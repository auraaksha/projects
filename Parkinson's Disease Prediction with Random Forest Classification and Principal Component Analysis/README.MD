This project was used as a final exam substitute for a biomedical informatics course. The project required each student to find a paper written in English which implements machine learning in the field of biomedics. The paper then used as a guide to write our code regarding the same topic. This project further evaluates the performance of the model with or without PCA and with different train/test split values (25/75, 50/50, 75/25). The final project was submitted on 27 June 2022 and presented during the scheduled final exam day.
