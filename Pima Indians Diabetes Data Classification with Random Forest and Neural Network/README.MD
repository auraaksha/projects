This project was used as a final exam substitute for a data analysis and visualization course. For the project, a pair of students were asked to find a case study pertaining to classification with random forest and implement it using either Python, R, or MatLab. 
My colleague (Rachmanita Bintarti Putri) and I chose to work with Python and added a neural network model in addition to the required random forest. I worked on the random forest model while she worked on the neural network model.
The final project was submitted on 10 January 2022 and presented during the scheduled final exam day.
